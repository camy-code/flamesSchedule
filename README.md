# flamesBOT9000
This is a discord bot to follow the Calgary flames! 

One will need to add a .env file and specify the tokens. In a demo video we will specify this furtherly!

We need to caution that the API is sometimes incorrect as to the dates so one may need to go up or down a day to get it to work.
